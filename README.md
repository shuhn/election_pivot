Initial Commit 10.3

During US presidential primaries there is often talk of the “general election pivot.” This much discussed phenomenon is meant to reflect the more moderate language candidates tend to take after winning their respective primaries. The goal of the pivot is electorally simple: garner more “independent” or “swing” voters to win the election.ddddd

The election of 2016 has deviated from the “norm” in countless ways. While the expectation in a normal election would be that Trump and Clinton would moderate their language in the weeks leading up to election day, this election is more unpredictable than ever. This project aims to understand the extent to which each major party candidate has shifted their language and overall campaign strategy in the final sprint to November 8th. ddfdfdfdfdfdfff

Debates provide a unique opportunity to hear the vision each candidate see for the country. These debates will be the primary area of focus for this project. I will perform analysis on the transcripts from three primary season debates and the first two general election debates with the following questions in mind:

1) Debate Dynamics: Has the assertiveness of either candidate changed?

2) Sentiment Analysis: Has the general tone of each candidate changed?

3) Summary Extraction: How do summaries for the primary debates compare to those for the general election? Are the overarching themes consistent?

4) Topic Modeling: How do the latent topics of each candidate compare across the two sets of debates?
