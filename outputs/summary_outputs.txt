**SUMMARIES (300 WORDS)**
TRUMP:
Border Patrol, people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what's happening.
Out of hundreds of deals that I've done, hundreds, on four occasions I've taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people.
Look, I'm just saying very simply we have a country that I've never seen anything like it.
But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.
There's something going on that maybe you don't know about, maybe a lot of other people don't know about, but there's tremendous hatred.
But I will tell you, I think if we're going to ever negotiate a peace settlement, which every Israeli wants, and I've spoken to the toughest and the sharpest, they all want peace, I think it would be much more helpful is I'm a negotiator.
What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making as usual with our country, we don't make good deal.
And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it's got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States.
People come with tremendous passion and love for the country, and when they see protest in some cases you know, you're mentioning one case, which I haven't seen, I heard about it, which I don't like.
And what a lot of people don't know because they were all saying, oh, you're going to take their property.

CLINTON:
And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them   Yes, well, I...[applause]...I...[applause]...I I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support.
I'm campaigning because I think I have the right combination of what the country needs, at this point, and I think I can take the fight to the Republicans, because we cannot afford a Republican to succeed Barack Obama as president of the United States.
I do support the use of medical marijuana, and I think even there we need to do a lot more research so that we know exactly how we're going to help people for whom medical marijuana provides relief.
Look, I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supports and I'm going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do, what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House and I hope to have their support when I'm the Democratic nominee.
I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V. show and I said, "it was outrageous that the governor hadn't acted and within two hours he had."   I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.
